# Titanic Survival Analysis & Clustering

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to uncover survival patterns using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and clustering techniques.

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings
- Dataset size: **891 rows Ã— 12 columns**
- **Clusters:** 5 (selected via elbow method)
- **Survival Insights:**
  - Kids from Southampton survived more often than those from other ports.
  - Seniors from Queenstown were less likely to survive.
  - Cherbourg passengers had a higher survival rate.
  - Clusters 3 and 4 had the highest survivability.
  - Females in Cluster 4 had the highest survival probability.

### Ideal Passenger Profiles
- **Cluster 2:** Male, 1st class, age 17â€“32, from Southampton, no siblings.
- **Cluster 4:** Female, 2nd class, age 17â€“32, from Cherbourg, no siblings
